# RNN-enhanced-XEB
 
## Getting Started
In this repo, we provide example codes for

- classical simulations 
- RNN models 

used in the preprint: 
"Neural network enhanced cross entropy benchmark for monitored circuits," Yangrui Hu, Yi Hong Teoh, William Witczak-Krempa, and Roger G. Melko, arXiv: 2501.13005 [quant-ph]


## Credit
- the classical simulation part is generated by Yangrui Hu
- in the classical simulation part, we exploit the Python package "ncon" generated by by Glen Evenbly (c) for www.tensors.net
- the RNN model is generated by Yi Hong Teoh


## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yhu1996/RNN-enhanced-XEB.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd RNN-enhanced-XEB-main
```

### Classical Simulations

In this part, 

- the folder "XEB" contains source codes for simulating the random monitored circuits. 
The unitary gates are native gates to trapped-ion devices, as introduced in the paper. 
- the folder "scripts" contains example scripts: 
	- generate_circuit.py: generate random circuits for a list of L's and p
	- histogram.py: compute the numerator and denominator in the definition of the cross entropy (see Eq. (7) in the paper); generate measurement outcome dataset
	- cross_entropy.py: simulate $M_C$ random circuit realizations and compute the cross entropy $chi_C$ for each circuit realization by sampling $M$ measurement outcomes


### RNN models

In this part,

- the folder "vanilla_rnn/paseq" contains source code for generating RNN models
- the folder "vanilla_rnn/script" contains example scripts: to run an example training, one can do the following

```bash
# run the example bash file
bash vanilla_rnn/script/test_run.sh
```
